# Superpixel-inpainting-for-skin-lesion-segmentation
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper 
* "Superpixel inpainting for self-supervised skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images", ISBI 2022
* "autoSMIM: Automatic Superpixel-based Masked Image Modeling for Skin Lesion Segmentation", TMI 2023 (in progress)

Since autoSMIM is still in progress, the source code will be released after the paper is accepted. If you are interested in my work, please email me at wzhjerry1112@gmail.com.
